## Required Configuration

### BPJS Account Setup
This system requires GL accounts (Chart of Accounts) to record BPJS deductions and expenses.

#### 1. Employee Deduction Accounts (Liability)
- BPJS Kesehatan - Employee
- BPJS JHT - Employee
- BPJS JP - Employee

#### 2. Company Expense Accounts (Expense)
- BPJS Kesehatan - Employer
- BPJS JHT - Employer
- BPJS JP - Employer
- BPJS JKK - Employer
- BPJS JKM - Employer

#### 3. Company Liability Accounts (Liability)
- BPJS Kesehatan - Employer
- BPJS JHT - Employer
- BPJS JP - Employer
- BPJS JKK - Employer
- BPJS JKM - Employer

> **Tip:** Place these accounts under Current Liabilities and Payroll Expenses according to your company's internal structure.

#### 4. BPJS Account Mapping Setup
1. Open DocType "BPJS Account Mapping"
2. Select your company
3. Link accounts for each component (employee & employer)
4. Save and activate for Salary Slip

#### 5. BPJS Settings Configuration
- Define contribution percentages (employee & employer) per component
- Set maximum salary thresholds
- Specify GL accounts for BPJS payments when using Payment Entry

### üßæ Salary Component Account Mapping
This module uses two strategies for determining GL accounts during Salary Slip processing:

#### ‚úÖ Default (Non-BPJS) Components
For regular components such as Basic Salary, Allowances, and Deductions, you must fill in the Default Account field in the Salary Component:

- Ensure that each Salary Component points to the correct account in your Chart of Accounts (e.g., Payroll Expense or Deductions).
- These accounts will be used when generating Journal Entries unless overridden.

#### üö´ BPJS Components (Auto-Mapped)
For all BPJS-related components, such as:
- BPJS Kesehatan (Employee & Employer)
- BPJS JHT (Employee & Employer)
- BPJS JP (Employee & Employer)
- BPJS JKK / JKM

Do not fill in the Default Account field in Salary Component.

Instead:
- The system will automatically determine the correct accounts using the BPJS Account Mapping document.
- This ensures flexibility and avoids conflicting entries across companies with different account structures.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This separation ensures that account logic is clean: manual for standard components, and dynamic/centralized for BPJS.

### PPh 21 Settings
This module supports two calculation methods:

- **Progressive** (default, according to tax bracket rates)
- **TER** (Effective Average Rate - per PMK 168/2023)

#### Configuration:
1. Open "PPh 21 Settings"
2. Select method: Progressive or TER
3. Fill in:
   - PTKP Table (PPh 21 PTKP)
   - Tax Bracket Table (PPh 21 Tax Bracket) for Progressive
   - TER Table (PPh 21 TER Table) for TER
4. Enable "Use TER for Monthly Calculation" if using TER method

## Module Structure
- **BPJS Settings** ‚Äì Configure rates and salary thresholds
- **BPJS Account Mapping** ‚Äì Account mapping per company
- **PPh 21 Settings** ‚Äì Tax method configuration

## Employee Setup for BPJS
To control BPJS enrollment on an employee-by-employee basis:

2. Set the following fields:
   - **ikut_bpjs_kesehatan**: Enable/disable BPJS Health Insurance
   - **ikut_bpjs_ketenagakerjaan**: Enable/disable BPJS Employment Insurance

## Memory Optimization
This module includes optimizations to reduce memory usage during salary slip processing:
- Field initialization to prevent NoneType errors
- Truncated error messages to avoid memory bloat
- Garbage collection during batch processing
- Optimized BPJS and tax calculations
